CloneDefaultText
=======================

Introduction
-------------------
This is a new default text plugin, which does not modify the value of input. Instead, it creates a clone of that input and places on the exact same location.

With this way, you won't have problems with default value being submitted.



How to use it
-------------------
<input type="text" id="test_textbox" class="test" style="color: green">

$('#test_textbox').default_text('this is default...');
