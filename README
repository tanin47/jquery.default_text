CloneDefaultText
=======================

Introduction
-------------------
This is a new default text plugin, which does not modify the value of input.
Instead, it creates a clone of that input and places on the exact same location.
With this way, you won't have problems with default value being submitted.

How it works
------------------
A text input, which contains a default text is cloned (using jQuery.clone()).
Then, it is placed exactly behind the real textbox.
And then we make the real textbox transparent.

It is only when the real textbox is focused, it is made opaque.
